Hello user,

The program starts with the register page which registers the new user to the database.
For the old or returning user sign in page is there namely "index.php".

After the login the frontpage consists of all the movies with only 3 attributes visible.
To see more attributes click on description button and to update the same movie click on update button and for deleting it click on delete button.

The logout button on each page logs you out of the session and redirects to the "index.php" page.


To start login
